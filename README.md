# OSINT-Monitoring-System

This program has been developed to monitor websites related with cybersecurity based on keywords in order to find public and new vulnerabilities which matches the chosen keywords.

If you wish, you can change it to monitor other websites, not related with cybersecurity as well as any other website on the web.

This version is old and is going to be redesigned and updated in NodeJs, JavaScript and AngularJS as it required a rails server (from Scrumblr) inside another rails server (main app). Also, there are a lot of bugs which need to be fixed.

Another technologies will also be used when needed.

You can see it running here:
